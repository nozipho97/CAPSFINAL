          <p>SEEK Lounge was opened late 2020, we were sitting around as friends during the covid massacre. We were just playing games having fun, one of my friends said instead of us sitting around doing nothing, how about we start a business bacuse already we had all the resources needed to start one, capital, space and the concept around it.

          We sat down and came up with a decision to start the business immediately, we forced things and went and registered and we began.

          <p>As time went by we saw that people came as numbers to support us, they wanted to sit and enjoy for more time; it is when we decided to expand the space to make it much bigger and welcoming. We started hiring more stuff ,experieenced and non-experienced we always wanted to make an impact in the community we lived in. We hired young people and actually made a difference in the unemployed youth. A restuarent opened, people came numbers to support us that is when we realized that what we started was big and from there we went up and never stopped.</p>
